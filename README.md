## Game Guide

### Corpse Room
The user starts in this room. Nothing can be done here except understand your purpose. Go South to start.

### Center Room
Initially nothing can be done in this room. Go West.

### Red Room
There is a table in the center of the room. There are three chests on top of it. The sentence we hear at the beginning should give us a hint about which chest to open. The sense of balance indicates that the valid chest is the center chest. Open the Center Chest and take the Center Key and the Red Ball. Unlock North with the Center Key. Go North.

### Orange Room
Anything with a purpose must first grow. There is another table in the room. There are three types of seeds on top of it. Take the Orange Seeds, as we are in the Orange Room. Take Water from the Bucket. Drop both the Water and the Orange Seeds into the Flower Pot. An orange tree grows with one Orange. Take the Orange and open it. Take the Yellow Key and Orange Ball that were inside the Orange. Go South to the Red Room. Unlock South with the Yellow Key.

### Yellow Room
Patience is virtue. Wait for a few seconds until the room makes two objects appear. Take the Green Key and the Yellow Ball. Go North to the Red Room and then Go East to the Center Room. Unlock East with the Green Key.

### Green Room
Quid pro quo. A favor for a favor. Take the Meat from the Cabinet and Drop it into the Emerald Crocodile. He will give you in return the Blue Key and the Green Ball. Unlock North with Blue Key.

### Blue Room
We desire what we don't have. The Right Statue envys what the Left Statue has. Take Gold, Silver and Bronze from the Left Statue and Drop it into the Right Statue. The Left Statue will cry a single Tear. Take the Tear. Open it and Take the Violet Key and the Blue Ball. Go South to the Green Room and Unlock South with the Violet Key.

### Violet Room
Triangular numbers are key. Triangular numbers follow the sequence 1, 3, 6, 10... Open the Violet Chest (1). Open the Box 3 inside Violet Chest. Open the Box 6 inside Box 3. Open the Box 10 inside Box 6. Take Violet Ball. Go North to Green Room and Go West to Center Room.

### Center Room
Now we have all six colored balls. The Stone Pillar has six holes and a rainbow carved on it. Drop the colors in the order of colors in a rainbow. Drop Red Ball in First Hole, Orange Ball in Second Hole, Yellow Ball in Third Hole, Green Ball in Fourth Hole, Blue Ball in Fifth Hole and Violet Ball in Sixth Hole. A White Ball will appear when all colors combine. Take White Ball. Unlock South with White Ball.
